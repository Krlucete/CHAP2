This software provides a combinatorial analysis of gene cluster evolution.
 generating an orthologous alignment in two species.

| Installation Instructions |
+---------------------------+

1) Our software can then be built with the command "make install".
The binaries are installed into the current working directory.

+--------------------------+
| Additional Configuration |
+--------------------------+

1) Our software uses output from the lastz alignment program as
well as output from RepeatMasker.  These are available at the
following locations:

	http://www.bx.psu.edu/miller_lab/
	http://www.repeatmasker.org/

2) Edit the top of the Makefile to set the locations of the lastz
and RepeatMasker executables.  The lines you need to edit are shown
below:

	# locations of lastz and RepeatMasker
	LASTZ        = lastz
	REPEATMASKER = RepeatMasker

+--------------------+
| Usage Instructions |
+--------------------+

1) Input files
	a) Sequence files in FASTA format 
		 - Save the sequence files in a directory called "seq.d" 
	b) The RepeatMasker out file of the information of interspersed repeats
after	running RepeakMasker program: 
		 - Copy "get_rm_out.sh" to the current working directory and type "get_rm_out.sh", then all sequences in seq.d are masked out. 
		 - The masked-out sequences are placed in new_seq.d and the RepeatMasker output files in rm_out.d.

2) Main program: Type "run_cage.sh"
  a) Preprocessing Steps: 
		 - running lastz and obtaining self alignments (and pairwise alignments if duplication histories of two sequences are inferred)
		 - masking out spurious small tandem repeats which are not masked out yet by RepeatMasker program
		 - chaining alignments together if they are broken by mutations and interspersed repeats
	b) After the preprocessing steps run, a maf-format file "new.maf" is generated. In "new.maf", 'a' line in each local alignment is a percentage identity for each alignment. 

3) Output files
	- estimated orthologous alignments in maf format
		e.g.) 

4) Example
	get_rm_out.sh
	cage.sh
