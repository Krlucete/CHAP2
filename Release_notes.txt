Release Notes for CHAP
-----------------------

2012-Jul-26:
  * Fixed a bug in the handling of masked repeats.
  * Removed pre-existing masking from sample input sequences for better
    illustration.
  * Re-ran the full pipeline on the example files to update output.

2012-Jul-02:
  * Fixed a bug in the optional helper script for inferring annotations
    (infer-annot.sh), so it can find the "dna" program.

2012-May-03:
  * Fixed a bug in the handling of tandem duplications by CAGE (the component
    that computes preliminary orthologs for use by the conversion detector).
  * Fixed a bug that occasionally caused a segfault when adjusting event
    endpoints for consistency among species.
  * Improved format checking for annotation files, with more helpful error
    messages.

2012-Mar-30:
  * CHAP 2 release.
  * Includes a new orthology mapping pipeline in addition to the conversion
    detector; output includes orthologous alignments (both by content and
    by context) for the entire cluster, along with ready-to-view PostScript
    diagrams showing orthology relationships among the genes.
  * User-supplied annotations are enhanced via automatic pseudogene detection.
  * When using the "_ps" suffix to indicate known pseudogenes in annotation
    files, the suffix should now be placed on the first word of the gene name.
  * Package files can be installed to user-specified locations that are
    separate from cluster data.
  * Files and directories have been reorganized somewhat; some are new and
    others have been moved and/or renamed.  In particular, note that the
    viewer scripts gmaj.sh and gmaj-mtm.sh are now called gmaj-conv.sh and
    gmaj-ortho.sh, respectively.
  * The gmaj-ortho.sh script has a new parameter to control which type of
    orthology is shown, and shades introns in pale gray to make it easier
    to see which exons are part of each gene.
  * A new utility script facilitates generating annotation files for
    non-reference species, using the external software Wise2.
  * The cleanout script now supports several different levels of thoroughness
    for more flexibility.
  * Scripts for diagram generation and alignment viewing allow substitution of
    different annotations from those used for conversion and orthology calls,
    and exit gracefully if Java is not available.
  * Better handling of underlay files for Gmaj, and improved handling of
    multi-word gene labels in Gmaj and the underlay generator.
  * Gmaj's "Help - Manual" menu item now points to a brief page with links
    to documentation.
  * Additional Gmaj improvements include: context-sensitive menus/shortcuts,
    new color PaleGray, and minor bug fixes.
  * Expanded documentation and better error messages.
  * Human gene names have been changed in the sample data for the alpha-globin
    cluster.

2011-Aug-02:
  * Updated Gmaj viewer: fixed ClassCastException on Macs with Java 1.6.

2011-Jun-10:
  * Fixes to improve consistency of results across different platforms.
  * Underlays for pseudogenes (with name suffix "_ps") are drawn in pale gray.
  * Advanced users can edit the CRIT_BOUND setting in conversion.sh to control
    the paralog coverage threshold for criterion selection.
  * The README file suggests which search engine and repeat database to install
    for RepeatMasker.

2011-Mar-17:
  * Initial public release.
